    <h3> All about us!</h3>
    <p> Ruskin's Cafe was found in 2015 in the loving memory of Ruskin Doe. He was a cheerful 12 year old who loved having croissants and pizzas.
       We aim to provide you a lovely ambience and amazing coffee with snacks so you can make full out of your coffee breaks.
      We also have a community support dog Marley who is out here to help you whenever you feel a bit down. Feel free to pet him even if you are in your happiest spirits!
